Our overall research focuses on developing high-performant, energy-efficient, and robust-and-reliable AI/ML systems, using a cross-layer full-stack approach spanning hardware, software, and algorithm. 

## Robust/Resilient AI/ML Systems
A "good" AI is not just about accuracy. It also needs to be robust/resilient against uncertainties, e.g., hardware faults/errors, adversarial input data, environmental variations, etc. How to make robust AI systems? <br/>

## Hardware Reliability --> Approximate Computing
As transistor becomes even smaller, hardware are more susceptible to errors/faults. How can we make reliable hardware?

## Fuzz Testing
A computing system needs comprehensive testing and validation. Fuzz testing is a popular testing method. Here are some examples:

## Brain-Inspired Hyperdimensional Computing
Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging AI model family mimicking the “human brain”. It achieves success in various applications. Check this coverage from [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/hyperdimensional-computing-reimagines-artificial-intelligence/), and a few examples below. <br/>
