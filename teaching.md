## Teaching
I love interaction with students and find trenmendous satisfaction when I share what I know with students. Often times, I learn more from my students than they learn from me. My teaching responsibility mainly lies on AI and machine learning related courses, as well as computer hardware courses such as computer organization. I teach both undergraduate and graduate level courses.
