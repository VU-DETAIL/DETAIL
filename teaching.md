## Teaching
My teaching responsibility mainly lies on AI and machine learning related courses, as well as computer hardware courses such as computer organization. I teach both undergraduate and graduate level courses. I created a new AI course in the past "Intro to AI", introducing freshmen the general concepts and implementation of AI. I created a new senior and graduate AI course on Machine Learning to introduce AI models and algorithms such as neural networks. 

I love interaction with students and find trenmendous satisfaction when I share what I know with students. Of course, I also get something nice in return (chocolate!).
